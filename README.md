# FluidSimulation
WebGL shader for mixed grid-particle fluid simulation

This simulation solves the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations" target="_blank">Navier-Stokes equations</a> for incompressible fluids in a GPU fragment shader.
I implemented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-slip_condition" target="_blank">no-slip boundary conditions</a> at the borders to keep the fluid contained within the bounds of the screen.
To increase performance, I solved for the velocity vector field of the fluid at a lower resolution than I used to compute the visualization of fluid flow; I used bilinear interpolation to smooth out artifacts caused by this speedup.
I've also added 160,000 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_particle_tracking" target="_blank">Lagrangian particles</a> on top of the simulation -
these particles are rendered using <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank">threejs</a>, but their positions are computed on the GPU.

<b>Instructions:</b> Click and drag to apply a force to the fluid.  Over time, the colored material in the fluid will dissipate:
